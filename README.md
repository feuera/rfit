# rFit
some experimenting with R, shiny, leaflet, plotly

idea is to read all strava activities and allow to display/analyse them offline. 

- [x] read gpx, tcx and fit files
- [x] display map and tracks
- [ ] store data efficiently (hdf5, ..?)
- [x] show multiple activities at once on map
- [ ] show multiple activities in graphs (for multiple tracking devices e.g. watch, phone, ..), different rider, or just overlapping segments

- [ ] extract and show summary, avg, .. for activies
- [ ] calculate summaries over time (monthly, annual km, ascending, ...)
